<summary><h2>📊 Ability Power</h2></summary>

When you press **C** and click on **Ability Power**, you’ll see all the categories that contribute to your overall power:  

- 🌟 **Talents**  
- 📘 **Skill Training**  
- ⚔️ **Gear**  
- 🔰 **Emblem**  
- 🔧 **Module**  
- *(as of today there’s a new category — name TBD)*  
- Another one is coming on **Sept 9th**  

These are the main systems to increase your character’s strength.

<details>
<summary><h3>🌟 Talents</h3></summary>

Talents are one of the biggest contributors to Ability Power.  
- Unlocking and upgrading talents increases core stats and abilities.  
- Completing **Trails** grants more points to expand your talent tree.  

👉 Always prioritize talents that boost your class’s main attributes.  

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>📘 Skill Training</h3></summary>

Skill Training enhances your combat abilities:  
- Upgrading **skills** increases their power and effectiveness.  
- Try to **maximize points** to unlock stronger abilities.  

👉 Don’t forget to revisit older skills — even basic ones scale well when upgraded.

<summary><h3>⚔️ Gear</h3></summary>

Gear progression has the largest direct impact on Ability Power.  

#### Equipment Tiers

For equipment, these are the three main categories you should know:

- **Purple** has two different tiers:  
  - *Entry Level* → provides Reforge up to **30%**  
  - *Superior* → provides Reforge up to **80%**

- **Gold** → leads you to **100%**

We all want Gold, but if that’s not achievable aim for Superior.

**Sources for gear tiers:**
- **Unstable / Gear Shop** = Entry  
- **Normal Dungeons** = Superior  
- **Chaotic Dungeons** = Gold

<summary><h3>🔰 Emblem</h3></summary>

Emblems add passive bonuses that contribute to Ability Power.  
- Equipping stronger emblems boosts your stats.  
- Some emblems have **set effects** when used together.  

👉 Experiment with different emblem setups depending on class role (DPS, Support, Tank).  

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🔧 Module</h3></summary>

Modules are late-game progression systems that enhance gear and abilities.  
- Attach modules to gear for additional stat customization.  
- Higher-rarity modules provide unique effects.  

👉 Prioritize farming modules that synergize with your build/playstyle.

<summary><h2>🏰 Dungeons</h2></summary>

Dungeons are the main source of higher-tier equipment.  

- **Unstable / Gear Shop** → Entry-level gear  
- **Normal Dungeons** → Superior gear  
- **Chaotic Dungeons** → Gold gear  

You also get a **first-time clear bonus** that guarantees a reward box.  
- These boxes let you choose between specific dungeon drops.  
- Example: *Goblin dungeon offers Earrings and (possibly) Arms.*  
- Open the box as your **preferred class** to maximize stat alignment.  

⚠️ Be aware: stats are random, and you may still roll suboptimal attributes even for your class.

<summary><h2>💡 Tips & Tricks</h2></summary>

- Aim for **Superior** gear if **Gold** is not achievable early.  
- Don’t rely solely on **first-time clear boxes** for perfect stats — they can still roll poorly.  
- Always invest in **Talents + Skills** alongside gear upgrades for balanced growth.  
- Track upcoming updates (e.g., new categories like Sept 9th) to stay ahead of progression.
