## 📊 Ability Power

If you press **C**, click on **Ability Power** text — you'll see all the categories that contribute to your power:  
- Refining  
- Reforge  
- Embedding  
- *(as of today there’s a new category — name TBD)*  
- Another one is coming on **Sept 9th**

These are ways to increase your equipment.

## ⚔️ Equipment Tiers

For equipment, these are the three main categories you should know:

- **Purple** has two different tiers:  
  - *Entry Level* → provides Reforge up to **30%**  
  - *Superior* → provides Reforge up to **80%**

- **Gold** → leads you to **100%**

We all want Gold, but if that’s not achievable aim for Superior.

**Sources for gear tiers:**
- **Unstable / Gear Shop** = Entry  
- **Normal Dungeons** = Superior  
- **Chaotic Dungeons** = Gold

## 🎁 First Time Clear

You have a **first time clear** which guarantees you a box.  
You can choose between the drops from the dungeon.  

**Example:** *Goblin dungeon offers Earrings and (possibly) Arms.*  
You can choose which one you want and open it as your preferred class to get stats that fit your class.  

⚠️ However, it’s not always the optimal stats — sometimes you’ll still get poor rolls even for your class.

## 🌟 Talent / Skills

Upgrading your **Skills** is important as well.  
Try to maximize all your points and unlock skills, as that will boost your power.  

Do the **Trails** — as you complete them you’ll earn more points towards your talent tree.
